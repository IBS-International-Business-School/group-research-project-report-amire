## Introduction
Understanding the differences in views of available support services among local and international students is critical for creating an inclusive and supportive academic environment. This study will look into how students perceive the accessibility, effectiveness, and adequacy of services such as academic, financial, emotional, social integration, cultural adjustment, and future ambitions support. The research topic motivating this study is: How do local and international students perceive available support services differently? It is hypothesised that international learners find these services less accessible and effective than their local equivalents. Cultural unfamiliarity, linguistic challenges, and a lack of information about institutional resources are all expected to contribute to this gap. By comparing experiences across these critical aspects, this study hopes to offer light on the particular obstacles that international students confront.

The primary goal is to identify gaps in institutional support and suggest concrete solutions. This study aims to give colleges with valuable insights into how to improve the student experience by analysing both quantitative and qualitative data. A more inclusive and well-structured support system will benefit international students while also enriching the campus atmosphere by encouraging cross-cultural understanding and long-term student achievement.


## Methodology
The methodology for this study included a carefully constructed survey designed to capture varied opinions from both international and local students. The survey was aimed to delve into important topics such as demographics, academic experiences, social integration, cultural adjustment, support systems, financial considerations, and future goals. To guarantee rigorous data collection, a variety of question types were used, including multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended forms. This combination made it easier to do quantitative analysis as well as gain deeper qualitative insights.

Participants were recruited using the school email were a google sheet form was sent to them. Efforts were made to assure representation at all levels of study, including undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate programs. This technique intended to provide a balanced dataset that truly reflected the diversity of the student population. The survey was distributed online over a secure infrastructure, making it easy for responders to access. Data collection lasted three weeks, and anonymity was ensured to encourage honest and full participation. This methodological framework was created to ensure the collection of trustworthy and useful data, allowing for a thorough examination of students' perspectives and experiences with institutional support services.

## Results
The t-test results show both similarities and variations in the experiences of local and international students at IBS, providing insight into academic perceptions, support systems, and financial issues.

The study found no significant change in judgements of the overall academic experience (T-Statistic: 0.22, p = 0.83) or the availability of mental health supports (T-Statistic: 0, p = 1). Both groups tend to have similar perspectives on these issues, implying that the academic and mental health support provided by IBS is viewed as equitable and consistent across populations. This parity emphasises the university's ability to provide an inclusive and cohesive academic atmosphere that caters equally to local and international students.

In terms of the cost of studying at IBS, the analysis (T-Statistic: 1.34, p = 0.19) demonstrates no significant difference between local and international students. While affordability remains an important factor for both groups, the absence of statistical significance shows that they share a view on the financial feasibility of their education, which could be impacted by comparable tuition structures or access to financial aid programs. However, there are variances in students' satisfaction with university services like counselling, academic advising, and career guidance. The t-test results (T-Statistic: -2.21, p = 0.034) show that international students valued these services significantly higher than local students. This disparity could indicate differences in expectations or the relative relevance of these services to each group. For international students, such support services may be critical for adapting to a new cultural and educational environment, whereas local students might rely less on them or hold different expectations.

Financial challenges proved to be another area of divergence. Local students reported facing significantly greater financial challenges than their international peers (T-Statistic: 2.96, p = 0.0056). This finding might be attributed to systemic differences, such as the availability of scholarships or work opportunities. International students often come prepared with financial plans or receive support from home countries, whereas local students might bear a heavier reliance on part-time work or loans, creating a perception of greater financial strain.

Overall, the survey results show that, while local and foreign students have similar experiences in major academic and institutional areas, discrepancies in service satisfaction and financial issues indicate that each group has unique needs and expectations. International students benefit considerably from IBS's strong support services, which appear to help them integrate and succeed. Local students, on the other hand, may benefit from focused measures to address their financial worries and adjust the supply of support services to better meet their expectations.

These findings highlight the need of sophisticated institutional initiatives for improving the student experience. It is critical to maintain a commitment to equal academic excellence and mental health resources. Addressing the financial challenges that local students encounter while personalising support services to their specific requirements will help to close satisfaction gaps. Such a strategy would ensure that IBS remains a centre of inclusivity, equity, and opportunity for both domestic and international students.
