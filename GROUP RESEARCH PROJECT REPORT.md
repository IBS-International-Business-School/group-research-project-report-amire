## Introduction
Understanding the differences in views of available support services among local and international students is critical for creating an inclusive and supportive academic environment. This study will look into how students perceive the accessibility, effectiveness, and adequacy of services such as academic, financial, emotional, social integration, cultural adjustment, and future ambitions support. The research topic motivating this study is: How do local and international students perceive available support services differently? It is hypothesised that international learners find these services less accessible and effective than their local equivalents. Cultural unfamiliarity, linguistic challenges, and a lack of information about institutional resources are all expected to contribute to this gap. By comparing experiences across these critical aspects, this study hopes to offer light on the particular obstacles that international students confront.

The primary goal is to identify gaps in institutional support and suggest concrete solutions. This study aims to give colleges with valuable insights into how to improve the student experience by analysing both quantitative and qualitative data. A more inclusive and well-structured support system will benefit international students while also enriching the campus atmosphere by encouraging cross-cultural understanding and long-term student achievement.


## Methodology
The methodology for this study included a carefully constructed survey designed to capture varied opinions from both international and local students. The survey was aimed to delve into important topics such as demographics, academic experiences, social integration, cultural adjustment, support systems, financial considerations, and future goals. To guarantee rigorous data collection, a variety of question types were used, including multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended forms. This combination made it easier to do quantitative analysis as well as gain deeper qualitative insights.

Participants were recruited using the school email were a google sheet form was sent to them. Efforts were made to assure representation at all levels of study, including undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate programs. This technique intended to provide a balanced dataset that truly reflected the diversity of the student population. The survey was distributed online over a secure infrastructure, making it easy for responders to access. Data collection lasted three weeks, and anonymity was ensured to encourage honest and full participation. This methodological framework was created to ensure the collection of trustworthy and useful data, allowing for a thorough examination of students' perspectives and experiences with institutional support services.

## Results
The t-test results show both similarities and variations in the experiences of local and international students at IBS, providing insight into academic perceptions, support systems, and financial issues.

The study found no significant change in judgements of the overall academic experience (T-Statistic: 0.22, p = 0.83) or the availability of mental health supports (T-Statistic: 0, p = 1). Both groups tend to have similar perspectives on these issues, implying that the academic and mental health support provided by IBS is viewed as equitable and consistent across populations. This parity emphasises the university's ability to provide an inclusive and cohesive academic atmosphere that caters equally to local and international students.

In terms of the cost of studying at IBS, the analysis (T-Statistic: 1.34, p = 0.19) demonstrates no significant difference between local and international students. While affordability remains an important factor for both groups, the absence of statistical significance shows that they share a view on the financial feasibility of their education, which could be impacted by comparable tuition structures or access to financial aid programs. However, there are variances in students' satisfaction with university services like counselling, academic advising, and career guidance. The t-test results (T-Statistic: -2.21, p = 0.034) show that international students valued these services significantly higher than local students. This disparity could indicate differences in expectations or the relative relevance of these services to each group. For international students, such support services may be critical for adapting to a new cultural and educational environment, whereas local students might rely less on them or hold different expectations.

Financial challenges proved to be another area of divergence. Local students reported facing significantly greater financial challenges than their international peers (T-Statistic: 2.96, p = 0.0056). This finding might be attributed to systemic differences, such as the availability of scholarships or work opportunities. International students often come prepared with financial plans or receive support from home countries, whereas local students might bear a heavier reliance on part-time work or loans, creating a perception of greater financial strain.

Overall, the survey results show that, while local and foreign students have similar experiences in major academic and institutional areas, discrepancies in service satisfaction and financial issues indicate that each group has unique needs and expectations. International students benefit considerably from IBS's strong support services, which appear to help them integrate and succeed. Local students, on the other hand, may benefit from focused measures to address their financial worries and adjust the supply of support services to better meet their expectations.

These findings highlight the need of sophisticated institutional initiatives for improving the student experience. It is critical to maintain a commitment to equal academic excellence and mental health resources. Addressing the financial challenges that local students encounter while personalising support services to their specific requirements will help to close satisfaction gaps. Such a strategy would ensure that IBS remains a centre of inclusivity, equity, and opportunity for both domestic and international students.
## Discussion
Analysing local and international students' experiences at IBS provides crucial insights into the institution's strategy for building an inclusive and supportive academic environment. These findings are consistent with research on student satisfaction, financial constraints, and the importance of support services in higher education, with far-reaching implications for institutional policy and student outcomes.

There are no significant variations in perceptions of the overall academic experience and the availability of mental health supports between local and international students, indicating a promising level of parity. Research done by Wanti et al (2022) shows that equitable access to quality education and mental health services is critical for student well-being and success. Therefore, we can say that IBSâ€™s ability to maintain consistency in these areas indicates a strong institutional foundation.  However, disparities in satisfaction with university services and financial issues highlight potential gaps in how IBS serves the different requirements of its students. International students' better satisfaction with support services is consistent with research showing that tailored support mechanisms, such as counseling and career advice, are critical for their transition and performance in foreign academic systems (Zeltner, 2018). In contrast, the larger financial constraints faced by local students match findings from national surveys indicating that domestic students frequently balance considerable financial responsibilities, such as part-time work and loan repayments (OpenAI, 2024).

These findings have a significant impact on IBS policies and practices. The large discrepancy in satisfaction with support services implies that local pupils may feel underserved or disconnected from these resources. Institutions should explore adapting services to address the specific issues of domestic students better, such as offering more flexible advising hours or promoting accessible resources, often via Outlook or any other means of communication that the school uses.  Addressing the financial needs of local students is equally important. Hence, IBS could target financial aid packages, on-campus employment possibilities, and financial literacy classes which could help to reduce some of the constraints that this group faces. International students' somewhat fewer financial issues may be due to pre-arranged sponsorships or scholarships, another reason could be that international students must prove they can afford tuition and living expenses for at least their first year to obtain a visa, ensuring greater financial stability upon arrival. These ideas could serve as a model for increasing support for local students.

##### Critical Assessment of the Survey
While the study gives useful information, it is not without limits. First, relying on self-reported data raises the possibility of bias. Respondents may exaggerate or underestimate their experiences due to social desirability or memory recall difficulties. To address this problem, future research could use triangulation approaches like interviews or focus groups to validate survey results. (OpenAI, 2024). The second weakness is the study's cross-sectional design. Student experiences are dynamic and can alter over time, impacted by variables such as institutional policy changes or external economic conditions. A longitudinal approach would yield a more sophisticated picture of how these events unfold. 

Finally, cultural, and environmental factors can influence how the findings are interpreted. For example, international students' contentment with support services may reflect reduced expectations due to cultural norms, rather than a genuine sense of superior quality. Local students' financial difficulties may be worsened by environmental variables such as regional economic differences.

##### Future Directions
To have a better understanding of student experiences, future Surveyâ€™s/research should look at how demographic factors like gender, field of study, and employment status interact. Expanding the scope to include comparisons to other institutions may also provide benchmarks for IBS's success. Furthermore, analyzing the long-term effects of service satisfaction and financial problems on student retention and success may provide useful insights for institutional planning.

Lastly, our Survey emphasized the significance of nuanced, focused interventions to meet the various requirements of both local and international students. IBS can improve its institutional diversity and support systems by utilizing its academic and mental health services, as well as addressing discrepancies in service satisfaction and financial problems. The findings are a call to action for IBS management, administrators, and teachers to constantly examine and change their practices to promote equity and opportunity for all its students.

## Conclusion
The project highlighted the diverse experiences of local and international students at IBS, demonstrating both strengths and places for growth. Key findings include equitable satisfaction across academic experiences and mental health resources, as well as discrepancies in satisfaction with university services and financial issues. While overseas students were more satisfied with support services, local students reported more financial challenges, highlighting the need for focused interventions to close these disparities. The discoveries have important real-world implications. This study emphasises the significance for educational institutions to adjust services to the individual needs of varied student populations. Offering flexible and well-communicated support to domestic students, as well as extending financial aid programs, can boost student satisfaction and retention.

These insights provide opportunity for corporations and organisations collaborating with educational institutions to collaborate on projects such as scholarship programs, mental health cooperation, or career development services tailored to certain student populations. In a larger sense, this study emphasises the value of diversity in education and its impact on student achievement. Investing in responsive and equitable support systems can help institutions improve their reputation, attract a more diverse student body, and improve graduates' long-term success. The findings of this study provide a platform for designing data-driven policies that promote fairness and support a healthy academic environment for all children.

## Reflection
Working as a group of four, we embraced Agile principles to effectively manage this project, emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and iterative progress. From the start, we established a clear project roadmap, assigning tasks based on individual skills and ensuring that everyone had a say in planning. Regular check-ins, like Agile stand-up meetings, enabled us to coordinate progress, identify impediments, and adjust to changes in scope or timelines. One major result was our ability to iteratively improve the research. Following the initial data analysis, we revised our technique based on group comments, increasing the interpretation of results and clarity of conclusions.

This iterative process ensured higher-quality products while leveraging the team's collective wisdom. Another accomplishment was the use of collaborative technologies to stay organised, which improved communication and documentation. However, difficulties occurred, such as balancing competing schedules and managing opposing perspectives about prioritisation. We addressed these issues by encouraging open communication and implementing Agile's emphasis on flexibility and continual development. Each team member contributed to solution development, ensuring that outcomes are shared. Overall, implementing Agile principles created a supportive environment, allowing us to effectively handle difficulties and produce a thorough project. This event underlined the need of teamwork and adaptation in team work.
