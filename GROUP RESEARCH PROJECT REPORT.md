## Introduction
Understanding the differences in views of available support services among local and international students is critical for creating an inclusive and supportive academic environment. This study will look into how students perceive the accessibility, effectiveness, and adequacy of services such as academic, financial, emotional, social integration, cultural adjustment, and future ambitions support. The research topic motivating this study is: How do local and international students perceive available support services differently? It is hypothesised that international learners find these services less accessible and effective than their local equivalents. Cultural unfamiliarity, linguistic challenges, and a lack of information about institutional resources are all expected to contribute to this gap. By comparing experiences across these critical aspects, this study hopes to offer light on the particular obstacles that international students confront.

The primary goal is to identify gaps in institutional support and suggest concrete solutions. This study aims to give colleges with valuable insights into how to improve the student experience by analysing both quantitative and qualitative data. A more inclusive and well-structured support system will benefit international students while also enriching the campus atmosphere by encouraging cross-cultural understanding and long-term student achievement.


## Methodology
The methodology for this study included a carefully constructed survey designed to capture varied opinions from both international and local students. The survey was aimed to delve into important topics such as demographics, academic experiences, social integration, cultural adjustment, support systems, financial considerations, and future goals. To guarantee rigorous data collection, a variety of question types were used, including multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended forms. This combination made it easier to do quantitative analysis as well as gain deeper qualitative insights.

Participants were recruited using the school email were a google sheet form was sent to them. Efforts were made to assure representation at all levels of study, including undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate programs. This technique intended to provide a balanced dataset that truly reflected the diversity of the student population. The survey was distributed online over a secure infrastructure, making it easy for responders to access. Data collection lasted three weeks, and anonymity was ensured to encourage honest and full participation. This methodological framework was created to ensure the collection of trustworthy and useful data, allowing for a thorough examination of students' perspectives and experiences with institutional support services.
